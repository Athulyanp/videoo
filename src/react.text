react          component based application

components : create a js file having  a name start with capital letter.

             two type of components
                1. class based component---- stateful component

                      it also has a default function for creating state
                2.function based component--- stateless component 
                       it means hasn't a default function for creating state

react hook : hook is predefined function and name start with 'use' keyword

   hook syntax:

         use predefined function()
         usestate() : it a function used to create a state.
          state creation syntax :
           
                 const[statename,statevalueUpdationfunction]=useState()

----props: props is used to share data between parent and child                 



----state : state is used to store values .(also state has an advantage to transfer values) we can share state to child component.
----conditional rendering: 



Redirection in Rect :-


1.   to install react router dom library  for navigation(redirect)  in index.js
2.   replace entire application (App.js)using Browser-router tag
     <BrouserRouter><App /></BrouserRouter>
3.   to set path in one or more page  using <Routes></Routes> tag  then
     set <route />in each page
     <Route path='/' element={component tag} />
4.   hook using navigation : useNavigate

API calling
AXIOS Features: (create a single api call):used for creating common api call
...............
step:1.import axios
     2. create a function for common api request
        ( body used in post method.)



--Make XMLHttpRequests from the browser
--Make http requests from node.js
--Supports the Promise API
--Intercept request and response
--Transform request and response data
--Cancel requests
--Automatic transforms for JSON data
--ðŸ†• Automatic data object serialization to multipart/form-data(used for uploading files or videos) and x-www-form-urlencoded body encodings
--Client side support for protecting against XSRF


Request Config:
..............
-----  These are the available config options for making requests. Only the url is required. Requests will default to GET if method is not specified.
   --- `url` is the server URL that will be used for the request
        url: '/user',

   ---- `method` is the request method to be used when making the request
        method: 'get', // default

   ----`baseURL` will be prepended to `url` unless `url` is absolute.
   ---- It can be convenient to set `baseURL` for an instance of axios to pass relative URLs
   ---- to methods of that instance.
   ---- baseURL: 'https://some-domain.com/api/',
   ----  // `headers` are custom headers to be sent
        headers: {'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest'},
          // `data` is the data to be sent as the request body
  // Only applicable for request methods 'PUT', 'POST', 'DELETE , and 'PATCH'
  // When no `transformRequest` is set, must be of one of the following types:
  // - string, plain object, ArrayBuffer, ArrayBufferView, URLSearchParams
  // - Browser only: FormData, File, Blob
  // - Node only: Stream, Buffer, FormData (form-data package)
  data: {
    firstName: 'Fred'
  },

use effect hook used for dom changes: it help for loading page automatically
map method used for 
props :share between parent to child

Entire product structure

parent ---->        app.js

child------>header   landing   home  footer
                                 .
                                 .
                                 .
 child of home..............>add  view category    

 data share between child to parent  , we use data trigering in add to view    
 we pass console.log(response.data) into getallvideos or useEffect
   steps: (for data share between child to parent)
   if response status 200
   1. first we store data into state of parent (home)  .it is called state lifting( data share between two siblings)
prevent default:
